# Test Guide

This document explains how to run the automated tests for this project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18 or newer** â€“ the server tests use the built-in `fetch` API which is available starting in Node 18.
- Install project dependencies with `npm install` if you haven't already.

## Running the Tests

Execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command runs the test suite using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). It will execute all tests in both the server and client directories.

To generate a coverage report run:

```bash
npx vitest run --coverage
```

This will:
- Run all tests with coverage collection enabled
- Generate both text output and HTML reports in the `./coverage` directory
- Display a summary table showing coverage percentages
- Create detailed HTML reports you can open in your browser at `./coverage/index.html`

The global report should show at least **98%** coverage for lines, branches, functions and statements.

**Note:** If the coverage command appears to hang or run tests repeatedly, this is normal behavior as it needs to instrument code for coverage analysis. The process takes longer than regular test runs but will complete with a detailed coverage report.


## Test Structure

### Client Tests
- **Hook Tests** (`client/src/hooks/__tests__/`):
  - `use-intersection-observer.test.tsx` - Tests intersection observer state management and cleanup
  - `use-mobile.test.tsx` - Tests mobile viewport detection and event listener cleanup
  - `use-toast.test.tsx` - Tests toast notification creation, dismissal, and reducer logic
  - `use-seo.test.tsx` - Tests SEO meta tag management (existing)

- **Component Tests** (`client/src/components/__tests__/`):
  - `Navbar.test.tsx` - Tests navigation component functionality (existing)
  - `quote-form.test.tsx` - Tests quote form validation and submission (existing)

### Server Tests
- **Core Server Tests** (`server/__tests__/`):
  - `index.test.ts` - Tests server initialization, analytics seeding, and error handling
  - `routes.test.ts` - Tests all API endpoints including CRUD operations and analytics routes
  - `storage.test.ts` - Tests in-memory storage operations for quotes, inventory, shipments, and analytics
  - `vite.test.ts` - Tests Vite development utilities and static file serving (skipped in CI environments)
  - `integration.test.tsx` - Full integration tests (existing)
=======

## Test Suites

### Server Tests

- **`server/__tests__/index.test.ts`** - Integration tests for the main server entry point, verifying:
  - Analytics initialization and setup
  - Server listening on port 5000
  - Error propagation through Express middleware
- **`server/__tests__/routes.test.ts`** - API route functionality tests
- **`server/__tests__/storage.test.ts`** - Storage layer tests
- **`server/__tests__/integration.test.tsx`** - Full integration tests with React components

### Client Tests

- **`client/src/__tests__/`** - Component and utility tests
- **`client/src/components/__tests__/`** - UI component tests
- **`client/src/hooks/__tests__/`** - Custom hook tests
- **`client/src/lib/__tests__/`** - Library utility tests
=======
## End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests live in the `e2e` directory and are powered by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### Prerequisites for E2E Tests

Before running e2e tests, you need to install the browser executables:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

**Note:** The first time you run e2e tests, you may encounter an error about missing browser executables. Run the install command above to resolve this.

### Running E2E Tests

Run them with:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

This uses the configuration defined in `playwright.config.ts`.

### E2E Test Configuration

The Playwright configuration (`playwright.config.ts`) includes:
- Test directory: `e2e/`
- Test file pattern: `**/*.e2e.ts`
- Base URL: `http://localhost:5000`
- Reporters: list and HTML (HTML report saved but not auto-opened)

### E2E Test Development

E2E tests should:
- Use the `.e2e.ts` file extension
- Be placed in the `e2e/` directory
- Target the local development server at `http://localhost:5000`
- Follow Playwright testing patterns and best practices

## Interpreting Results

- When all tests pass, the command exits with code `0` and displays success messages for each suite.
- If any test fails, Vitest reports the failing test name along with an error stack trace.
- The final exit code reflects whether the suite succeeded or failed, which is useful for CI pipelines.
- Some tests may be skipped in certain environments (e.g., Vite tests are skipped when build dependencies are unavailable).
