# Test Guide

This document explains how to run the automated tests for this project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18 or newer** â€“ the server tests use the built-in `fetch` API which is available starting in Node 18.
- Install project dependencies with `npm install` if you haven't already.

## Running the Tests

Execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command runs the test suite using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). It will execute all tests in both the server and client directories.

To generate a coverage report run:

```bash
npx vitest run --coverage
```

The global report should show at least **98%** coverage for lines, branches, functions and statements.

## Test Suites

### Server Tests

- **`server/__tests__/index.test.ts`** - Integration tests for the main server entry point, verifying:
  - Analytics initialization and setup
  - Server listening on port 5000
  - Error propagation through Express middleware
- **`server/__tests__/routes.test.ts`** - API route functionality tests
- **`server/__tests__/storage.test.ts`** - Storage layer tests
- **`server/__tests__/integration.test.tsx`** - Full integration tests with React components

### Client Tests

- **`client/src/__tests__/`** - Component and utility tests
- **`client/src/components/__tests__/`** - UI component tests
- **`client/src/hooks/__tests__/`** - Custom hook tests
- **`client/src/lib/__tests__/`** - Library utility tests

## Interpreting Results

- When all tests pass, the command exits with code `0` and displays success messages for each suite.
- If any test fails, Vitest reports the failing test name along with an error stack trace.
- The final exit code reflects whether the suite succeeded or failed, which is useful for CI pipelines.
