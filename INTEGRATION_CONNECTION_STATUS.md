# Integration Connection Status & Implementation Guide

## Current Connection Status

### DocuSign Integration: ✅ READY (Consent Required)
**Status**: Authentication successful, requires user consent
**JWT Authentication**: ✅ Working correctly
**Private Key Validation**: ✅ Successful
**API Credentials**: ✅ Valid

**Required Action**: User consent must be granted via OAuth flow
- Consent URL: https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth/auth?response_type=code&scope=signature%20impersonation&client_id=dea51199-a1e0-4948-afca-c39274320387&redirect_uri=https://www.tsgfulfillment.com/employee&state=docusign_consent
- Once consent is granted, the integration will be fully functional

### HubSpot Integration: ❌ SCOPE PERMISSIONS REQUIRED
**Status**: Authentication working but missing required scopes
**Access Token**: ✅ Valid
**API Connection**: ✅ Working

**Required Action**: HubSpot app requires additional scopes
- Missing scopes: `crm.schemas.contacts.read`, `crm.objects.contacts.read`, `crm.objects.contacts.sensitive.read.v2`, `crm.objects.contacts.highly_sensitive.read.v2`
- Access token must be regenerated with proper scopes in HubSpot developer portal

## Detailed Implementation Instructions

### Phase 1: Complete DocuSign Integration (5 minutes)

1. **Grant DocuSign Consent**
   - Visit the consent URL provided above
   - Authenticate with DocuSign credentials
   - Grant the requested permissions
   - You will be redirected to https://www.tsgfulfillment.com/employee

2. **Verify DocuSign Connection**
   - Test endpoint: `GET /api/test/docusign`
   - Expected response: `{"service":"DocuSign","status":"connected"}`

### Phase 2: Fix HubSpot Integration (15 minutes)

1. **Access HubSpot Developer Portal**
   - Log into https://developers.hubspot.com/

     - `crm.objects.contacts.sensitive.read.v2`
     - `crm.objects.contacts.highly_sensitive.read.v2`

3. **Regenerate Access Token**
   - After adding scopes, generate new access token
   - Update `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable
   - Restart application

4. **Verify HubSpot Connection**
   - Test endpoint: `GET /api/test/hubspot`
   - Expected response: `{"service":"HubSpot","status":"connected"}`

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Available
- `GET /api/employee/quotes` - List all quote requests
- `POST /api/employee/quotes/:id/assign` - Assign quote to sales team member
- `POST /api/employee/quotes/:id/hubspot` - Sync quote to HubSpot
- `POST /api/employee/contracts` - Send contract via DocuSign
- `GET /api/employee/contracts/:id/status` - Check contract signature status
- `GET /api/employee/inventory` - View inventory levels
- `POST /api/employee/inventory` - Update inventory
- `GET /api/employee/vendors` - Manage vendor relationships

### Database Schema
All necessary tables are created and ready:

- `contracts` - Contract tracking with DocuSign envelope IDs
- `inventory_levels` - Material inventory with reorder alerts
- `vendors` - Vendor contact and performance data
- `shipments` - Tracking shipment status and logistics
- `order_statistics` - Analytics data for reporting
- `client_kpis` - Performance metrics

### Authentication & Security

- ✅ Role-based access control for employee portal

## Next Steps Priority Order

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Grant DocuSign consent (immediate)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Update HubSpot scopes and regenerate token (15 min)
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Test both integrations with real data
4. **LOW PRIORITY**: Train team on Employee Portal features

## Support & Troubleshooting

### DocuSign Issues
- If consent URL doesn't work, verify redirect URI in DocuSign app settings
- Check that Integration Key matches environment variable
- Ensure private key format is correct (PEM format with proper line breaks)

### HubSpot Issues
- Verify all required scopes are granted in developer portal
- Check that access token has not expired
- Confirm API rate limits are not exceeded

### General Issues
- Check environment variables are properly set
- Verify database connection is stable
- Monitor application logs for detailed error messages
