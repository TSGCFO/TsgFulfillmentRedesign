# Render Build Fix Instructions

## Issue Analysis
The Render deployment failed because build dependencies (`@vitejs/plugin-react`) are in devDependencies but needed during production build.

## Solution 1: Use Render Blueprint (Recommended)
Create your web service using the `render.yaml` file which includes all necessary configuration:

1. In Render Dashboard, select "Deploy from Blueprint"
2. Connect your GitHub repository 
3. Use the `render.yaml` file in your root directory
4. This will automatically configure all environment variables and build settings

## Solution 2: Manual Configuration
If creating manually in Render Dashboard:

### Build Command
```bash
npm ci && npm run build --production=false
```

### Start Command
```bash
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
Add exactly as provided in RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md

## Solution 3: Alternative Build Command
If still having issues, use this build command:
```bash
npm install --include=dev && npm run build
```

This forces installation of devDependencies during build phase.

## Current Status
- Database migration completed successfully
- All tables created in production PostgreSQL
- Environment variables configured
- Health check endpoint available at `/health`

The deployment is ready - the build dependency issue just needs the correct Render configuration.
